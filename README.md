# Mesh adaptation for tidal turbine problems solved using [Thetis]

This repo provides extensions to Thetis' 2D solver to enable mesh
adaptive solutions to tidal turbine problems. Mesh adaptation
functionality is driven by [Pyroteus].

This is research of the Applied Modelling and Computation Group
([AMCG]) at Imperial College London.
